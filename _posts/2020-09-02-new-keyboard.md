Last week my new keyboard arrived: the Ergodox. I was interested in picking up a mechanical keyboard and after doing some research on which ones would be compatible with macOS, I settled on the Ergodox.

As a full-time programmer and hobbyist programmer/writer, I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Something that would improve the ergonomics of my workstation was pretty appealing to me.

My first impression of the keyboard is pretty positive! Obviously my typing speed has reduced dramatically, plummeting from about 70 WPM to around 15 WPM. After two days of typing, I thought it might also be a good time to look into layouts other than QWERTY. I've since settled on Dvorak and have been using typingclub.com to help me practice. Of course that means my typing speed has only gotten slower!

I'm a bit confused by the tent kit, since the keyboard felt fairly comfortable lying, and I'm not quite sure how to adjust it to the ideal configuration for me. I've played with it a little bit and I have found a height that feels a little more comfortable and makes reaching some of the keys on the top row easier, so I guess I must be doing something right!

I've also been playing with the layout configuration a bit, namely for the supporting keys and the thumb clusters. Still finding something that works for me, but so far it has been nice having a dedicated key for opening Alfred, and an easier to reach escape key.
