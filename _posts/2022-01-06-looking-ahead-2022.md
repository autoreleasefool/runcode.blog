After taking a look back at 2021, I figured it would also be appropriate to consider 2022, and what I'd like to accomplish in this upcoming year. I have some loose goals, some personal challenges, and hopefully a fun year to look forward to.

# Goals

## Read 12 Books

I've slowly been getting back into reading more over the past 2 years, culminating in reading 7 full books in 2021, sneaking one in on the final day of the year! So in 2022, I'll aim to read one book a month, which still feels very achievable, despite, perhaps, the record not reflecting my ability to complete that many books in a year. But I've been accruing a hefty backlog of books, I've got the time to read them now, and I'd love to make it a focus this year to start working through them.

## Run a sub-40:00 10K

I have been striving for a sub-40:00 10K for a couple years now. I would be remiss if I did not include it as another goal this year, as I continue to strive to drive my 10K time down. In 2020, I managed a 40:26 10K, but my training took a hit in 2021. I've started off strong this year, and hopefully I can achieve this in May, at the Toronto Marathon 10K.

# Challenges

## January Running Streak

Starting the year off strong with a running streak is starting to become something I really look forward to! I thought this year's challenge would be slightly easier, being in Vancouver and lacking snow, but I'm _not_ in Vancouver, and even if it was, it's covered in snow as well!

## Dry January

I don't have a particularly strained relationship with alcohol, though if we talk, you'd know I definitely don't make it sound that way. However, I do spend too much money on it every month, and I sometimes use it as an excuse to avoid going on a run after work, by cracking a beer too early in the evening. Lacking this excuse will also, hopefully, help me out in maintaining my running streak.

## One Project a Month

I spent most of 2016 and most of 2020 working on 2 different projects that eventually lead toâ€¦ nothing! They're polished projects, but they're not very useful beyond that. It's made me realize that I've got too many fun ideas to spend an entire year devoted to one. So I try to limit myself to really focusing on a project for no more than about a month. After that, I push myself to consider sunsetting it and starting something new, and more fun!

In 2021, this lead to me getting through about 6 different projects, and even "completing" (as much as any personal project can be completed) 4 of those!
