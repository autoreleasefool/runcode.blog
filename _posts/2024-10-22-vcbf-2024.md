This year's Haiku Invitational for the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival has [announced its winners](https://vcbf.ca/winning_haiku/2024-winning-haiku/).

Unfortunately, I didn't make the cut this year.

Instead, I share my poems with you:

## Poem 1

```
"Your time will come" they say
as if we couldn't be
cherry blossoms in march
```

## Poem 2

```
Children dying, crying
for mothers. Don't they know
the cherries are blossoming
```
