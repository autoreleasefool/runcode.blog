Each year I like to set some broad intentions I like to fallback on to help me shape the year. I didn't really share this last year, but I had 2 broad themes for the year in my personal development: [Approach, my app for 5 Pin Bowling](https://tryapproach.app/), and the [Squamish 50](https://squamish50.com/).

For 2024, I'd like to set a new theme: Birds.

Birds have been among my favourite animals for years, and after getting more into photography with my first DSLR in 2018, I've wanted to focus my hobby. Loving nature so much, I tried to get out on hikes with my camera whenever possibly, and now I want to explore photography a little differently. So this year I'll do that by trying to capture some birds!

As any hobby, I want this to be for me first. But I'm looking forward to sharing my photos, learning more about how to identify birds, and building a new personal birding journal.

See you out there ðŸ‘‹
