This year's Haiku Invitational for the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival has [announced its winners](https://vcbf.ca/winning_haiku/2023-winning-haiku/).

I was very proud to see both mine and Sarah's poems selected for honourable mentions.

For you, my poem:

```
they blossom
and i wait patiently
for my turn
```
