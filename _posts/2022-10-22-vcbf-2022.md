This year's Haiku Invitational for the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival has [announced its winners](https://vcbf.ca/winning_haiku/2022-winning-haiku/).

I'm happy to say one of my poems was selected as an honourable mention!

```
Cherry petals in her hair
and it's no longer my place
to brush them away
```
